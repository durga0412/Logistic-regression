# Logistic-regression
Implementing logistic regression To find out either a person is alive or not


Inference to be shown:

You have more than one feature here, and If the value of the model predicts 0.79, that would mean a person is 79% alive and 21% dead.

Intermediate steps involved:

1. Countplot for survived vs sex
2. Find out the number of missing values
3. Boxplot for P-class and age
4. Heatmap to check for null values.
